- refactor the code for getting the embedding of an image, encapsulate all code in the FaceNetModel class
- add a similarity method to calculate if the embeddings are for the same person or not
- add code to loop over all the persons in the images folder
- detect the name of the person by its image
- integrate it with the face detection, make this process automated
